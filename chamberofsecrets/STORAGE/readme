Welcome to Abilityhub. This app simulates an imaginary web site where individual users can buy and sell services amongst each other. Each user has a profile where they can advertise their services through their description or uploaded images. Communication between users is carried out via the app’s own messaging platform and there are also credits which function as the platform’s designated digital currency. Users can deposit (= buy) credits using “real” money. As things stand, there is no withdrawal functionality but in principle it ought to exist.  

I have created three accounts to demonstrate the app’s cyber security vulnerabilities. The credentials are {admin / admin}, {cyrus_bertie / b3rtie1sB3st} and {beatrice_curry / YumCurry}. The latter two are the “main characters” but feel free to use the admin credentials to access the admin panel where all data can be tinkered with. Cyrus Bertie is our cyber criminal whereas Beatrice Curry is an innocent entrepreneur looking to fix bicycles. To get started, I recommend logging in as Cyrus and perhaps having a look around the site before going through the flaws in order. The flaws represent four different risks from the 2021 edition of OWASP top 10 plus CSRF. 

To avoid confusion, please note that Abilityhub uses a model called “Person” to refer to users and from here on out the term “person” shall be used in this text, too. Additionally, it shall be pointed out that there is an auxiliary django app called “chamberofsecrets”. All the necessary instructions for using the chamber are included in the flaw descriptions.
